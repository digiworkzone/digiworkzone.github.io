      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
          After working in the media industry for over a decade, in my
          exploration of new skills to learn, i poured my energy, time and
          resources into learning web development alongside UX/UI. <br />
          there’s never an end to learning is what i’ve come to realise, after
          countless 80 hours a week learning and practice sessions, i decided to
          test out my skills on some simple but useful projects. which you can
          view in the projects section.
